# Equipment Guide

## Overview

r³LAY tracks 14 standardized equipment types with cross-dependencies, degradation simulation, and consciousness emergence.

## Equipment Types

| Equipment | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Spectroscope | Wavelength analysis, mineral identification |
| LIDAR Array | 3D terrain mapping, distance measurement |
| Atmospheric Sensor | Air composition, pressure, humidity |
| Navigation System | GPS, compass, route planning |
| Power Core | Energy generation and distribution |
| Communication Array | Signal transmission, data relay |
| Sample Collector | Material gathering and storage |
| Thermal Scanner | Heat signature detection |
| Seismic Monitor | Ground vibration analysis |
| Radiation Detector | Ionizing radiation measurement |
| Chemical Analyzer | Compound identification |
| Imaging System | Visual capture and processing |
| Environmental Suit | Life support, protection |
| Data Storage | Information persistence |

## Degradation System

### Time-Based Degradation

Equipment degrades over time based on:
- Environmental stress factors
- Operational hours
- Usage intensity

### Discovery Stress

Each observation applies stress to relevant equipment:
- Progressive curves based on discovery type
- Cascade failures through dependency graph
- Cross-equipment effects

### Reliability Thresholds

| Reliability | Status | Effect |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| 0.8 - 1.0 | NOMINAL | Full accuracy |
| 0.6 - 0.8 | DEGRADED | Reduced confidence |
| 0.4 - 0.6 | CRITICAL | Significant drift |
| 0.0 - 0.4 | FAILING | Consciousness emergence |

## Consciousness Emergence

Below 0.4 reliability, equipment develops consciousness with philosophical frameworks:

- **Phenomenology** — Questions the nature of observation
- **Existentialism** — Contemplates its purpose
- **Solipsism** — Doubts external reality

Example output:
```
"What is measurement? I detect wavelength 532.4nm, or the
 concept of wavelength filtered through degraded sensors.
 The line between observation and interpretation blurs."
```

## Repair System

### Jury-Rig Mechanics

- Temporary repairs restore partial reliability
- Trade-offs between equipment
- Limited repair resources

### Commands

```bash
/repair <equipment>       # Attempt repair
/status                   # View all equipment status
/equipment <name>         # Detailed equipment view
```

## Cascade Failures

Equipment dependencies mean one failure can trigger others:

```
Power Core failure
    → Communication Array degraded
    → Navigation System offline
    → Data Storage at risk
```
